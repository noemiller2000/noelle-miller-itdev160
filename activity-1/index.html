    <p>
      Below, I will be talking about my favorite animal:</p>
    <h2>The Mantis Shrimp</h2>
    <p>
      They have some of the weirdest and coolest traits I've ever seen.<br />
      Here's a list of some of my favorites facts:
      <ul>
        <li>They come in a variety of vibrant colors (Just go ahead and google the Peacock Mantis Shrimp).</li>
        <li>While the human eye can detect three color wavelengths, the Mantis Shrimp can detect <em>twelve</em>.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Try to imagine there are nine colors that you can't see but the Mantis Shrimp can. Pretty crazy, right?</li>
        </ul>
        <li>There are two types of Mantis Shrimp, spearers and smashers.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The smasher type is definitely where the Mantis Shrimp shines,
            with punches that have the same acceleration as a 22 caliber bullet.</li>
          <li>The speed and power of the punches actually cause vacuums and shockwaves to form underwater.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Probably best to end the list there, since I don't think we can get much better than tiny underwater explosions.<br />
    This concludes my mantis shrimp appreciation post.</p>
